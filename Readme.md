# Altura test project

You're tasked with designing a simple mobile app that allows users to input a twelve-
word recovery seed, derive and store their private key, and view their ETH balance and

address. The app should be designed using React Native and TypeScript, and it should
work on both iOS and Android devices.

# How to run project.

- `yarn`
- `yarn run ios`
- `yarn run android`

# Note

- If you run face some dependency issues, you can run this `npx pod-install` in ios.

- This is demo how to make flow in wallet project. So I've used simple status management library `zustand`,`react-native-aes-crypto`
- Because of time limit, I did not focus on UI at all.
- As a UI library, I've used `nativewind`.
- Did not install commit management tool like `husky`
